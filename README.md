## 📚 My Academic Journey

As a proud graduate of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali, my academic path has been both diverse and intensive. With a major in Biological Sciences and a minor in Science Education, I've delved deep into the fascinating world of biology and natural sciences. 

My coursework has spanned a range of topics, from Advanced Developmental Biology and Biochemistry to the intricate Structure and Function of Genomes. Not limited to biology alone, I've also explored Spectroscopic Methods, Energetics and Dynamics of Chemical Reactions, Thermodynamics, and Statistical Physics. 

An essential part of my journey has been the integration of computational methods into my studies. I've honed my skills in bioinformatics, utilizing Python and R to analyze and interpret complex biological data, bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative research in natural sciences.
